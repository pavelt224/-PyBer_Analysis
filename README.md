Overview of the Research:

# Explain what the new analysis is for.
The goal of this written report is to compile a DataFrame that summarizes ride-sharing data by city type. This report will feature multiple-line graphs of total weekly fares for each city type, created with the Pandas and Matplotlib tools.

Figure 1: Total Fare by City
The distinction between rural, urban, and suburban city types may be seen in the graph above. Between the months of January and April, the fare in urban centres is the highest and most consistent. Rural city fares are the cheapest of the three city kinds, and unlike the Urban and Suburban city types, the fares never cross. Despite the fact that the tickets never cross, the Urban fares start at an average of $1,800 and rise to $2,300 as the months pass. The Suburban rates, on the other hand, began at $1,000; however, the pattern was not consistent, since the fare fell in March and even further in mid-April. Rural rates began at $200 and continued to rise and fall until the end of April. One thing the three city types have in common is a fare hike near the end of February.
